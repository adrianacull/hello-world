# hello-world
a github newb

Adri here, i'm a total newb at all this. I'm in the process of learning javaScript and then C++ when I'm done the JS course. 
I have an idea for a dating app that I want to create. I also hope that maybe in years down the line I can use some of this training and hopefully, by then, experience to pursue a new career.
